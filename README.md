## data_visualization

There are several ways to view the Data Visualizations:
1) Python code (.py files). Beware that you may need to add some code to show the interactive plots.
2) Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files). This is probably best if you have Jupyter/Anaconda installed and want to see the code and the visualizations.
3) Web pages (.html files).  You will also need the custom.css file to display these correctly. You may also view these at http://kishar.net/index.php?page=DATAV
